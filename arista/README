Included are two scripts to collect metrics off of Arista switches.
Arista runs Fedora Core 14 i686. You will need to build Ganglia for it
then install.

1. ganglia_arista_interfaces.py - provides interface statistics such as
   number of bytes in/out, errors, collisions etc.
2. ganglia_arista_transceivers.py - provides transceiver stats such as
   voltage, optical power, temperature
