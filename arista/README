Included are two scripts to collect metrics off of Arista switches.
Arista runs Fedora Core 14 i686. You will need to build Ganglia for it
then install.

1. ganglia_arista_interfaces.py - provides interface statistics such as
   number of bytes in/out, errors, collisions etc.
2. ganglia_arista_transceivers.py - provides transceiver stats such as
   voltage, optical power, temperature

**30-Apr-2014 - Update to eAPI**
Updated ganglia_arista_interfaces.py to use eAPI which is the support method
for interfacing with EOS programmically.  eAPI must be configured on the
node.  To configure eAPI, enter the following commands in config
mode:

```
eos#configure
eos(config)#username eapi secret password
eos(config)#management api http-commands
eos(config-mgmt-api-http-cmds)#no shutdown
eos(config-mgmt-api-http-cmds)#
```

In addition the script can now be run either on-box or off-box.  Use
python ganglia_arisa_interfaces.py --help to see command line options for
using the updated script with eAPI.
